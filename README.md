# 30MFF Website
## Project Name: Connections - The Movie
### Project Description
The main concept of the website was to brand and showcase the film that my group (Kyle Adams, Jeongin Lee and myself) made for our 30 Minute Film Festival in our Comm Lab class. The theme of our film was "connections" and in our film, we tried to portray how significantly the past few months have changed the way we communicate and connect with what we love. Sometimes, all you need is something very small to connect with what you love the most.  
  
Since this was the first website I was making, I had my eyes on three main things with regards to basics of the website; the website should work (of course), it shouldn't look bad to the eye (in terms of styling and positioning), and it shouldn't fall apart when I use it on a mobile, for instance.  
  
Regarding the experience, I constantly had the theme in mind and I wanted to keep the website simple, but with good colors and fonts. This approach allowed me to enhance the experience in a way where the user would pay more attention to the content of the web pages, and that would allow me to brand my film in a simple and efficient manner.  
  
### Process
To start off, I began adding html to my index.html file, which was the home page of my website. At this point, my goal was to have everything on the page. Whenever I would add an element to the html, I would simultaneously style it using CSS to ensure that the there was nothing wrong with the basic styling and positioning.  
  
Starting from the first page, I made myself comfortable with CSS flexbox container because I used these multiple times in my code, and once I was able to understand how they worked, it made thing very simple for me. I used the flexbox container twice, first for the video and next for a combination of text and image and then styled all of it accordingly.  
  
For the second page, I used a flexbox container once again with 3 different items in the "row" direction. This essentially allowed me to split my page into 3 parts where I added the pictures, name and descriptions of all members of the group. I also used flex properties to wrap the text and the image as the screen got smaller.  
  
Making the third page was fun, but it was also the one I spent the most time on. I made a slideshow but at this point, I had to take a lot of help from different resources. I had to use previous and next buttons, change the display properties of some of my slides and style them accordingly. This also meant that I introduce JavaScript at the same time to help me with supporting the functionalities of buttons and relevant elements. Here, I also applied a greyscale filter to the images and they would only return to the original color upon hovering.  
  
For the last page, it was relatively simple, adding contacts and social media links. However, my friend saw me downloading images of icons and introduced me to [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and I think this was the coolest thing ever, since it represented icons in the form of text and made things extremely simple to use.  
  
### Reflection

  

After I was done adding the html and CSS for a page, I would move to doing the same for the next page and so on. The entire process was about experimenting (when things didn't work) and learning (when I didn't know how to implement what I wanted to implement
