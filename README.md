# 30MFF Website
## Project Name: Connections - The Movie
### Project Description
The main concept of the website was to brand and showcase the film that my group (Kyle Adams, Jeongin Lee and myself) made for our 30 Minute Film Festival in our Comm Lab class. The theme of our film was "connections" and in our film, we tried to portray how significantly the past few months have changed the way we communicate and connect with what we love. Sometimes, all you need is something very small to connect with what you love the most.  
  
Since this was the first website I was making, I had my eyes on three main things with regards to basics of the website: the website should work (of course), it shouldn't look bad to the eye (in terms of styling and positioning), and it shouldn't fall apart when I use it on a mobile, for instance.  
  
Regarding the experience, I constantly had the theme in mind and I wanted to keep the website simple, but with good colors and fonts. This approach allowed me to enhance the experience in a way where the user would pay more attention to the content of the web pages, and that would allow me to brand my film better.
