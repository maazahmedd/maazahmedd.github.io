# Connections: The Movie
## 30MFF Website
Since this was the first website I was making, I had my eyes on three main things: the website should work (of course), it shouldn't look bad to the eye (in terms of fonts, icons and images), and it shouldn't fall apart when I use it on a mobile, for instance.
I think I did a good job.
