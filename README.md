# 30MFF Website
## Project Name: Connections - The Movie
### Project Description
The main concept of the website was to brand and showcase the film that my group (Kyle Adams, Jeongin Lee and myself) made for our 30 Minute Film Festival in our Comm Lab class. The theme of our film was "connections" and in our film, we tried to portray how significantly the past few months have changed the way we communicate and connect with what we love. Sometimes, all you need is something very small to connect with what you love the most.  
  
Since this was the first website I was making, I had my eyes on three main things with regards to basics of the website: the website should work (of course), it shouldn't look bad to the eye (in terms of fonts, icons and images), and it shouldn't fall apart when I use it on a mobile, for instance.  
  
I think I did a good job.
