				<h2 class="actor-name">Maaz Ahmed</h2>
				<p class="actors-bio">Maaz is a sophomore from Karachi, Pakistan. He is majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Interactive Media. If you are someone who loves sports, you are 100% likely to have an amazing conversation with him. When he is free, in fact even when he is not, you will find him watching Rafa Nadal's best forehands or Marcus Rashford scoring a goal in front of The Stretford End.</p>

			<div class="flexbox-item3">
				<img class="actors-img" src="kyle.png"/>
				<h2 class="actor-name">Kyle Adams</h2>
				<p class="actors-bio">Kyle is a senior from the United States. It is safe to say that Kyle is one of the coolest people you will meet in Comm Lab, mainly because of his very diverse interests. Kyle has experience in web development, cinematography as well as in Social Research and Public Policy. He is also an amazing photographer, so if you want a portrait in front of the NYU Abu Dhabi campus, feel free to hit him up!</p>

			<div class="flexbox-item3">
				<img class="actors-img" src="jeongin.png"/>
				<h2 class="actor-name">Jeongin Lee</h2>
				<p class="actors-bio">Jeongin is a sophomore from South Korea. She is majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Interactive Media (this is becoming a pretty famous combo). Jeongin loves cats, so if you ever see someone coding on the NYU Abu Dhabi highline while petting one of the campus cats, feel free to say hi because you know it's most likely Jeongin!</p>
