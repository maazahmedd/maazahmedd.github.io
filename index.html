				<h1>How this film came into existence</h1>
				<p class="about-text">When three old friends, Jeongin, Kyle and Maaz met over Zoom for their weekly catchup, they knew it was finally time to come up with something new, something very different. The past year and a half had changed everything for the world, but more importantly, it had changed the way we would communicate and connect with what we love the most; be it people, objects or places. However, when the three reflected on their recent experiences, they realized that all of them had found newer ways to connect with what they loved the most. They decided to document this realization in the form of the film you saw above, named "Connections". Being physically close is indeed an important part of staying connected, but sometimes you just need to find the string, the wire or the rope to connect with what you love the most.</p>
